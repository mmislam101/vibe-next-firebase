I have the app running locally by:
- one terminal running `npm run functions`
- another terminal running `npm run dev`

Please:
- Do not do another npm run for functions or dev
- Assume that the app will hot reload
  - Test changes using curl commands, when appropriate
  - Have the user restart the functions or dev
